\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$typename Child, Unit U, Exponent... Es$>$\newline
struct units\+::derived\+\_\+dimension$<$ Child, U, Es $>$}
The list of exponents of dimensions (both base and derived) provided by the user. 

This is the user\textquotesingle{}s interface to create derived dimensions. Exponents list can contain powers of factors of both base and derived dimensions. This is called a \char`\"{}recipe\char`\"{} of the dimension and among others is used to print unnamed coherent units of this dimension.

Coherent unit is a unit that, for a given system of quantities and for a chosen set of base units, is a product of powers of base units with no other proportionality factor than one.

The implementation is responsible for unpacking all of the dimensions into a list containing only base dimensions and their factors and putting them to derived\+\_\+dimension\+\_\+base class template.

Sometimes units of equivalent quantities in different systems of units do not share the same reference so they cannot be easily converted to each other. An example can be a pressure for which a coherent unit in SI is pascal and in CGS barye. Those two units are not directly related with each other with some ratio. As they both are coherent units of their dimensions, the ratio between them is directly determined by the ratios of base units defined in base dimensions end their exponents in the derived dimension recipe. To provide interoperability of such quantities of different systems mag is being used. The result of the division of two mag of two quantities of equivalent dimensions in two different systems gives a ratio between their coherent units. Alternatively, the user would always have to directly define a barye in terms of pascal or vice versa.
