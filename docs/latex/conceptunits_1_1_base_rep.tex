\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Any type which can be used as a basis vector in a Base\+Power. 

We have two categories.

The first is just an {\ttfamily std\+::intmax\+\_\+t}. This is for prime number bases. These can always be used directly as NTTPs.

The second category is a {\itshape custom type}, which has a static member variable of type {\ttfamily long double} that holds its value. We choose {\ttfamily long double} to get the greatest degree of precision; users who need a different type can convert from this at compile time. This category is for any irrational base we admit into our representation (on which, more details below).

The reason we can\textquotesingle{}t hold the value directly for floating point bases is so that we can support some compilers (e.\+g., GCC 10) which don\textquotesingle{}t yet permit floating point NTTPs.
