There is a \href{build.sh}{\texttt{ helper script}} to build the fuzzers, which has only been tested on Debian and Ubuntu linux so far. There should be no problems fuzzing on Windows (using clang\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}=8) or on Mac, but the script will probably not work out of the box.

Something along 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir\ build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd\ build}
\DoxyCodeLine{export\ CXX=clang++}
\DoxyCodeLine{export\ CXXFLAGS="{}-\/fsanitize=fuzzer-\/no-\/link\ -\/DFUZZING\_BUILD\_MODE\_UNSAFE\_FOR\_PRODUCTION=\ -\/g"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\ ..\ -\/DFMT\_SAFE\_DURATION\_CAST=On\ -\/DFMT\_FUZZ=On\ -\/DFMT\_FUZZ\_LINKMAIN=Off\ -\/DFMT\_FUZZ\_LDFLAGS="{}-\/fsanitize=fuzzer"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\ -\/-\/build\ .}

\end{DoxyCode}
 should work to build the fuzzers for all platforms which clang supports.

Execute a fuzzer with for instance 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd\ build}
\DoxyCodeLine{export\ UBSAN\_OPTIONS=halt\_on\_error=1}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir\ out\_chrono}
\DoxyCodeLine{bin/fuzzer\_chrono\_duration\ out\_chrono}

\end{DoxyCode}
