\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$Base\+Rep T$>$\newline
struct units\+::base\+\_\+power$<$ T $>$}
A basis vector in our magnitude representation, raised to some rational power. 

The public API is that there is a {\ttfamily power} member variable (of type {\ttfamily ratio}), and a {\ttfamily get\+\_\+base()} member function (of type either {\ttfamily std\+::intmax\+\_\+t} or {\ttfamily long double}, as appropriate), for any specialization.

These types exist to be used as NTTPs for the variadic {\ttfamily magnitude\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}...\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} template. We represent a magnitude (which is a positive real number) as the product of rational powers of \char`\"{}basis vectors\char`\"{}, where each \char`\"{}basis vector\char`\"{} is a positive real number. \char`\"{}\+Addition\char`\"{} in this vector space corresponds to {\itshape multiplying} two real numbers. \char`\"{}\+Scalar multiplication\char`\"{} corresponds to {\itshape raising} a real number to a {\itshape rational power}. Thus, this representation of positive real numbers maps them onto a vector space over the rationals, supporting the operations of products and rational powers.

(Note that this is the same representation we already use for dimensions.)

As in any vector space, the set of basis vectors must be linearly independent\+: that is, no product of basis powers can ever give the null vector (which in this case represents the number 1), unless all scalars (again, in this case, {\itshape powers}) are zero. To achieve this, we use the following kinds of basis vectors.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Prime numbers. (These are the only allowable values for {\ttfamily std\+::intmax\+\_\+t} base.)
\item Certain selected irrational numbers, such as pi.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Before allowing a new irrational base, make sure that it {\itshape cannot} be represented as the product of rational powers of {\itshape existing} bases, including both prime numbers and any other irrational bases. For example, even though {\ttfamily sqrt(2)} is irrational, we must not ever use it as a base; instead, we would use {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{structunits_1_1base__power}{base\+\_\+power}}\{2, ratio\{1, 2\}\}}.
